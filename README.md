## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions (churn). The dataset includes customer account information, subscription details, and viewing behavior.


Key steps performed in this project:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering, encoding and scaling
- Model training using XGBoost 
- Model evaluation with various metrics, including ROC-AUC, precision, recall and the confusion matrix
- Using the XGBoost model to make final prediction probabilities for churn, ranking top 14% among participants in this challenge
